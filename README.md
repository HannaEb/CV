I am a light hearted, open minded and intuitive junior web developer with a great passion for learning and numbers. I recently graduated from Makers Academy, an intensive 16 week coding boot camp where I was introduced to languages such as Ruby and JavaScript as well as various frameworks and programming practices. But most importantly I learned how to learn! I am now looking to work with a great team in a challenging and inspiring environment where I can continue to learn and improve my skills on a daily basis.

## Skills

#### Logic

Having a logical mind has always been one of my greatest strengths. I have always found it relatively easy to see the bigger picture and connect the dots to make sense of a new situation or task. This ability has been of great help throughout my professional life but especially at Makers Academy, where I succeeded in grasping a variety of new concepts and picking up new frameworks within a short period of time. From learning the basics of Javascript in a week to teaching myself Ionic for my final project, being a fast learner was absolutely essential!

#### Teamwork & Communication

I strongly believe these two go hand in hand! Many years of experience as a restaurant manager with twice-daily staff briefings, weekly cross-departmental managers meetings and multinational, ever changing teams have taught me the importance of being open minded, willing to see things from a different perspective as well as being able to express myself clearly. Daily pair-programming, retrospectives, stand-ups and team projects at Makers Academy have further contributed to my firm belief that communication and teamwork are essential in any professional environment.

#### Being Adaptable

Studying and working in five different countries and three different industries has greatly improved my flexibility and ability to quickly adapt to new situations. Especially while I was self-employed I regularly had to adapt to a new work environment and new people with different backgrounds. This skill was of great benefit at Makers Academy where I successfully worked on various projects with daily changing pair partners.

#### Curiosity

Why do the wheels of a car sometimes look like they are spinning backwards? What are imaginary numbers? And what happens if you fall into a Black Hole? Questions like these are endlessly fascinating to me. I have a great passion for trying to understand how the world works and love learning new things about anything and everything on a daily basis. You can never know too much!
