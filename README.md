## Skills

#### Teamwork & Communication

I strongly believe these two go hand in hand, you cannot successfully work as a team and achieve your goals without properly communicating with each other. Many years of experience as a restaurant manager with twice-daily staff briefings, weekly cross-departmental managers meetings and multinational, ever changing teams have taught me the importance of being open minded, willing to see things from a different perspective as well as being able to express myself clearly. Daily pair-programming, retrospectives, stand-ups and team projects at Makers Academy have further contributed to my firm belief that communication and teamwork are essential in any professional environment.

#### Being Adaptable

Studying and working in five different countries and 3 different industries has greatly improved my flexibility and ability to quickly adapt to new situations. Especially while I was self-employed I regularly had to adapt to a new work environment and new people with different backgrounds, often on a daily basis. This skill was of great benefit at Makers Academy where I successfully worked on various projects with daily changing pair partners and managed to grasp a variety of new concepts and pick up new frameworks within a short period of time. 

#### Curiosity

Why do the wheels of a car sometimes look like they are spinning backwards? What are imaginary numbers? And what happens if you fall into a Black Hole? Questions like these are endlessly fascinating to me. I have a great passion for trying to understand how the world works and love learning new things about anything and everything on a daily basis. You can never know too much!
